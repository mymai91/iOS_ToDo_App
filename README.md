How we can do it?

To show list todo tasks on the screen we need use:
- TableViewController -> For this case we will use TodoTableViewController
- Each task is TableViewCell -> For this case we will use TaskTableViewCell
- To manage of each cell we will define an object -> for this case we will call it is Task object.
